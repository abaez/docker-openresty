## A modulized container for Openresty by [Alejandro Baez](https://twitter.com/a_baez)


### DESCRIPTION
A simple container for Openresty. Needed something that I could control the
build release. Due note, that you need to extend the `Dockerfile` for it to
actually work. Did this on purpose for ease of applying to other services. May
change the functionality later on.
